# Random Quote Generator
Random Quote Generator project for Treehouse's FS-JS Techdegree

## What is this?
This is a simple quote generator written in HTML, CSS, and JS. This project's primary purpose was to get me practicing the JS basics I have learned in Unit 1.

## How do I use this?
Well, the project isn't much, but every 10 seconds a new quote will display on the screen and the background color will change. Also, if you're the impatient type, you can hit the "Show another quote" button to immediately display a new quote.

Now go be inspired!
